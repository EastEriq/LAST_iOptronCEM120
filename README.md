# LAST_iOptronCEM120
iOptron CEM120 mounts matlab hardware class for LAST.

Ancestor project: [IOptronMountMatlab](https://github.com/EastEriq/IOptronMountMatlab).

It is left to the responsibility of the LAST integrator to copy or link the files of this project into an `+obs\+instr` tree. I couln't think of any viable directory structure satisfying both `git` project naming constraints (even considering `subtree`s and `submodule`s) and Matlab/MAAT/LAST organization requirements.
